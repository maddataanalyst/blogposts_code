# Intro

This small project accompanies the article "Networked Narratives: Leveraging LLMs and GNNs for Next-Generation Knowledge Graphs".

# Contents

Inside this folder you'll find the following files:

1. `article_to_graph_llm.ipynb` - This notebook contains the code for the LLM-based knowledge graph generation.
2. `graph_doc.pkl` and `manual_graph_from_text.pkl` - These files contain the knowledge graph generated by the LLM and the manually created graph, respectively. You can replicate the results by reading them in the notebook.
3. `llm_graph.html` - HTML visualization of the LLM-generated graph.

# Setup

Use `uv` to create the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

```bash
uv venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to use LLMs, you'll need to add the `.env` file with proper API keys.
