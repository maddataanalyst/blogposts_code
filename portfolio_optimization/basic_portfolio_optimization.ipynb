    "Portfolio optimization is a critical tool for modern investors willing to maximize their capital utilization in the market and expected returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many portfolio optimization techniques are based on different variants of constrained quadratic programming formalizations, taking as inputs expected asset returns, forms of risk metrics (like covariance matrices), and transaction costs. Next, the goal is selected (typically a maximization of return while keeping the risk level constant or minimizing the risk with varying returns ). The problem is solved either via a closed-form equation or a gradient-minimizing approach. Additional elements or steps can be included, like periodical rebalancing, the inclusion of transaction costs, or different cost functions (Sharpe ratio or similar). \n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post will show you how to prepare and perform a simple portfolio optimization process on selected stocks. Two approaches will be utilized - purely mathematical formulation of the optimization problem and PyPorfolioOpt library that automates most of the process. \n",

    "The first important thing is to define what a portfolio is. In layperson's terms, the portfolio is a set of different assets (stocks, bonds, etc. - in general: different financial instruments) (Luenberger, 1997). Typically investors seek diversification of capital, so they want to have various types of assets.\n",

    "Here is a brief summary of what topics were covered in this post:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A portfolio is a set of assets/financial instruments that hold some value;\n",
    "2. These assets can have different weights, contributing to the total reward by the end of the period;\n",
    "3. The process of finding optimal weights (concerning some constraints and objectives - below) is called portfolio optimization;\n",
    "4. As the name suggests - this process (in its basic form) is a constrained linear programming problem;\n",
    "5. One of the best-known tools for solving such problems is called the \"Markovitz model\", which either:\n",
    "    1. minimizes risk for predefined minimal return;\n",
    "    2. maximizes return while trying to keep the risk below the maximally accepted level;\n",
    "6. Various portfolio compositions can be plotted using efficient frontier - on the risk-reward scale;\n",
    "7. Such problems can be solved in Python either:\n",
    "    1. using optimization libraries like CVXPY;\n",
    "    2. Using specialized libraries for portfolio optimization, like PyPortfolioOpt."
